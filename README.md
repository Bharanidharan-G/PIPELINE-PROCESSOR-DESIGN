# PIPELINE-PROCESSOR-DESIGN

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: BHARANIDHARAN

INTERN ID: CT08OPX

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW:

This project involves designing a 4-stage pipelined processor that supports basic instructions, including:

ADD (Addition)
SUB (Subtraction)
LOAD (Memory Load Operation)

The processor is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and follows a 4-stage pipeline design:

Fetch (IF) – Instruction fetching from memory.
Decode (ID) – Instruction decoding and operand fetching.
Execute (EX) – ALU operation execution.
Write-back (WB) – Writing results back to registers/memory.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Design a 4-stage pipelined processor in Verilog/VHDL.
Implement data forwarding and hazard detection if required.
Simulate and verify each pipeline stage.

DELIVERABLES:

✅ Processor Verilog/VHDL Code
✅ Testbench for Functional Verification
✅ Simulation Showing Each Pipeline Stage
